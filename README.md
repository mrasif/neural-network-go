# Neural Network Go

Neural Network Go is a project built from scratch in Go (Golang) that demonstrates the implementation of a basic neural network. This project is designed to provide a clear and concise example of how neural networks can be constructed and trained using Go, focusing on simplicity and educational value. It includes basic functionality making it a great starting point for anyone interested in understanding neural networks and exploring machine learning concepts in Go.
